<p style="width:48%;float:right;font-family:candara"> Along with Bollywood, Maharashtra takes pride in is its lush canopies that together form the western ghats, a biodiversity hotspot. 
Under the shadow of the western ghats, which mostly locals call Sahyadri Ranges, many hilly hamlets are blooming, the cool aura which even drew Britons upwards and
 downwards during the British Raj era. Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, Matheran, Mhaismal, Lonavala, Khandala, Amboli, and Malshej Ghat are the famous summer getaways of Maharashtra,
 and they are accessible too. Most of them must be having the similar silhouette, but each has its unique characteristic charm, charisma, and allure. Some them are rising high and tall to
 create a thumbs up, some are getting straight down into the Arabian sea, while another mender around waterfall and lake.<br><br>

Besides the hill stations, the eastern region of Maharashtra has some of the most promising national parks, where there are chances to spot tigers and many other mammals and birds. 
All in all, there are six wildlife reserves in Maharashtra that attracts an impressive range of animals, including Crocodiles, Bisons, Gawas, Neelgais, and numerous other avian species.
 Amongst all these parks, the must visit for wildlife tours are Tadoba National Park and Navegaon National Park, which keeps on buzzing with tourists even in the offseason to seek relaxation,
 and jeep safaris.<br><br>

Since all the hill stations and jungles of the Maharashtra are quite pristine, so to explore all these hidden gems, travelers are often seen heading to these places to take part in treks like
 Torna Trek, Raigad Trek, Visapur Fort Trek, Shivneri Trek, Harishchandragad Trek, Lohgad Trek, Kalsubai Peak Trek, Vasota Fort Trek, to name a few. Apart from trekking, rafting, 
and paragliding are some of the activities that keep one on their toes and leave their hearts filled with thrill and elation. To further add a little thrill to the adventure vacation, one can sign
 up for a white water rafting over river Kundalika, near the western ghats.<br><br>

From hotel bookings to transportation, everything will be a part of these travel packages.
 The packages will include a visit to all the famous attractions and make sure that travelers
 get the whimsical experience.<br><br>

<p style="width:48%;float:left;font-family:candara"> Vast, varied, vibrant and extremely vivacious - Maharashtra has a thing when it comes to urbanization and rapid development that is hard to find anywhere else in India. It's a paradisiacal 
paradox -subtle yet energetic; wild but manicured, and hushes yet fueled by rapid urbanization. Along with its stronghold on commercialism, Maharashtra is a winner in the category of tourism too. 
In this 307,713 km2 land, which makes it the third largest state in India, there are some irresistible holiday destinations that are not only meant for the nature lovers but also for the religiously 
inclined travelers. For a vacation in Maharashtra, there is abundance natural beauty to soothe the senses; beaches that are the best places to unwind; exceptional shrines that are the epitome of 
architectural excellence and rich flora and fauna that makes it a biodiversity hotspot. In nutshell, Maharashtra is untouched, intriguing, captivating, and picture as perfect.<br><br>

To begin the brief introduction of Maharashtra, it's important to know about its origination. As per the historical records, one can see the traces of Maharashtra since the days of Maurya Empire in the
 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Later it has witnessed the presence of many rulers - Western Satraps, Gupta Empire, Gurjara-Pratihara, Vakataka, Kadambas, Chalukya Empire, Rashtrakuta Dynasty, Western Chalukya,
 and Yadava. Amongst all these, the most talked about were the rulers of Marathas, who were later dethroned by the British after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. The presence of much unique distinctive dynastic remains 
reflecting through their archeological treasures, which are counted amongst the popular places to visit in Maharashtra.<br><br>

Over a long period of time, Maharashtra has witnessed the rule of different rulers. And the testaments of the same can be seen over in its forts, caves, and places. There are over 350 vestiges in Maharashtra but the 
primarily known are Ajanta Ellora caves. An outstanding specimen of ancient Indian architectural heritages, all these caves are shrines cut out of the rock by hand. Other prominent tourist's places to visit for a 
sightseeing tour are Raigadh Fort, Vijaydurg Fort, Sindhudurg Fort, Pratapgadh Fort, Shaniwar Wada, Lal Mahal, Ahmednagar Fort, Bibi Ka Maqbara, and Daulatabad Fort. Some architectural masterpieces of Maharashtra
 have a colonial touch like Gateway of India, Rajabai Clock Tower and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Portuguese too has left their mark in Maharashtra in the form of the Vasai Fort, which was initially built a ship building site.<br><br>
